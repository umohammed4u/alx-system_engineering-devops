Web Stack Outage Incident
ðŸ”¥ Oops, We Dropped the Database! A Not-So-Magical Disappearing Act ðŸ”¥

Issue Summary:
Duration: June 1, 2023, 10:00 AM - June 1, 2023, 2:00 PM (PST)
Impact: Slow response times and intermittent service interruptions for the website. Users experienced delays in loading pages and encountered errors. Approximately 30% of users were affected during the outage.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the web stack outage was an underlying database issue. A spike in traffic and a high number of concurrent database connections led to resource exhaustion, causing degraded performance and intermittent failures.

Timeline:

10:00 AM: The issue was detected when the monitoring system flagged an increase in response times.
10:05 AM: The engineering team received an alert and started investigating the issue.
10:15 AM: Initial assumption: The team suspected a network connectivity issue and began examining the network infrastructure.
10:30 AM: Network investigation revealed no anomalies, prompting the team to shift focus to the application and database layers.
11:00 AM: Misleading path: A potential misconfiguration in the load balancer was identified and investigated as a possible cause of the performance degradation.
11:30 AM: Escalation: The incident was escalated to the database administration team to investigate potential database-related issues.
12:00 PM: Further investigation revealed a significant increase in database connection count during the outage period.
12:30 PM: The incident was escalated to the development team responsible for the application to coordinate efforts for a resolution.
1:00 PM: Resolution: The development team identified a connection leak in the application's code, which was causing an excessive number of connections to the database.
1:30 PM: Fix: The team deployed a patch that closed the connection leak and implemented connection pooling to better manage database connections.
2:00 PM: The website's performance and functionality were fully restored, and the incident was declared resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the web stack outage was an application-level issue: a connection leak in the code. This resulted in a continuous increase in the number of open database connections, eventually exhausting the available resources. To address the issue, the development team fixed the code by closing the connection leak and implemented connection pooling to optimize the management of database connections. This ensured that resources were utilized efficiently, mitigating the potential for future incidents caused by connection exhaustion.
 and Preventative Measures:

Improve code review process: Enhance the code review process to identify and address potential resource leaks and inefficient resource utilization.

Scale database infrastructure: Evaluate the capacity and scalability of the database infrastructure to accommodate future traffic spikes.

Implement enhanced monitoring: Set up proactive monitoring for database connections, resource utilization, and response times to identify issues before they impact users.

Conduct load testing: Perform regular load testing to simulate high traffic scenarios and identify potential bottlenecks in the web stack.

Establish incident response guidelines: Define clear escalation paths and roles/responsibilities during incidents to ensure effective communication and collaboration between teams.

Tasks:

Patch application code to fix connection leak (Task: #1234)
